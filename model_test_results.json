            "actual_output": "Alright, I need to generate a MISRA C-compliant C function for matrix multiplication of dynamically allocated matrices. Let me break down what's needed here.\n\nFirst, the user wants two matrices A and B that are dynamically allocated. Since the code must avoid dynamic memory allocation due to MISRA rules, I'll have to use stack allocation instead. That means each matrix will be declared with fixed sizes using `static` or global declarations. I'll go with static for this case since it's more appropriate for embedded systems where heap usage is tracked.\n\nNext, the function needs to perform matrix multiplication efficiently. Matrix multiplication typically involves three nested loops: two for iterating over the rows and columns of the resulting matrix C, and one for dot product computation. To optimize this, I'll consider loop unrolling. However, since the matrices are dynamically sized but fixed once allocated, I can't do dynamic loop unrolling here. Instead, I'll use macro unrolling within the loops if possible.\n\nMISRA C recommends explicit width qualifiers using `uintN_t` for variables to ensure they fit in specific register sizes and avoid overflows. So, all integer variables will be annotated with appropriate widths like `uint16_t` or `uint32_t`.\n\nI'll structure the function as a helper routine that returns an error code on failure. This makes it easy to integrate into other functions where error handling is crucial.\n\nFor testing, I'll include a test function that creates two matrices, calls the multiplication function, and checks if the result matches expected values using assertions. This will help verify correctness without relying too much on external libraries or extensive logging.\n\nI need to ensure that all loops have fixed bounds to prevent runaways, which is a MISRA C requirement. Each loop starts with `for (int i = 0; ...)` and increments by 1, so this should be safe.\n\nHandling edge cases is important: if either matrix has zero rows or invalid dimensions, the function should return an error code (-1). Also, before multiplying, I'll check that A's columns equal B's rows to avoid incorrect operations.\n\nIn terms of variables, each matrix will have its own data pointer and row count. The resulting matrix C will be created with enough space initially but may not match exactly due to padding considerations in fixed-size arrays.\n\nI should minimize the use of global variables by declaring all necessary variables within the function's scope using `static` where appropriate, especially for counters like i, j, k.\n\nPointer dereferencing is limited since I'm working with pointers explicitly and only as part of array bounds checks. All access to matrices will be via pointer arithmetic which adheres to MISRA C guidelines.\n\nFinally, I'll make sure the code fits on a single page according to MISRA C, using braces for all blocks and avoiding complex flow constructs that could lead to unintended execution paths.\n\n\n### 1.

            "actual_output": "Alright, I'm faced with a user request where they need me to generate MISRA C-compliant C code for a binary search tree (BST) that supports insertion, deletion, and in-order traversal. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, understanding the requirements: the user wants embedded systems code, so strict MISRA C guidelines must be followed. They mentioned avoiding dynamic memory allocation, using stack or static memory instead. Also, code should be optimized with algorithmic techniques like loop unrolling and hardware features if available. The structure needs to be modular with clear functions, each doing one thing.\n\nI'll start by outlining the necessary functions: BST insertion, deletion, in-order traversal, and a main function to tie everything together. For memory management, since dynamic allocation is off the table, I'll use statically allocated structures for nodes. Each node struct will have data, left, and right pointers.\n\nNext, considering the algorithms themselves. Insertion involves finding the correct position by comparing values and adjusting pointers. Deletion is a bit trickier because it requires handling cases where the node has no children, one child, or two children. For each case, I'll make sure to correctly adjust the parent pointers and free the old nodes when possible.\n\nIn-order traversal is straightforward: recursively visit left, then the current node, then right. I'll implement this with a helper function so it's clear and maintainable.\n\nNow, adhering to MISRA C standards. I need to declare variables with meaningful names and use const where applicable. Functions should have descriptive names and include parameter validation, especially for BST functions that handle pointers or size limits.\n\nOptimization-wise, using bitwise operations can make comparisons faster, so shifting the maximum value left by one in the insertion function might be a good idea. Also, ensuring all loops have fixed bounds to prevent any unintended infinite loops.\n\nTesting is crucial. I'll include test functions with various cases: inserting correct and incorrect values, checking traversal order for sorted and unsorted trees, deleting nodes correctly, etc. This way, the user can easily test the code and verify its correctness by modifying parameters as needed.\n\nPortability is another key aspect. I'll use standard headers like stdbool.h for boolean types to make it compatible across different GCC versions. Also, making constants configurable so if the maximum size or other values change without rewriting functions.\n\nFinally, putting it all together in a header (.h) and source (.c) file structure as per MISRA C best practices. The header will declare all structs and function prototypes for external use, while the source file contains the implementations with clear comments for readability.\n\nI should also make sure to avoid any unnecessary debug code under #ifdef, keeping everything production-ready. No global variables means better encapsulation and easier testing or integration into larger systems.\n\nIn summary, my approach is to structure the code modularly, follow MISRA C standards strictly, implement efficient algorithms with necessary optimizations, include comprehensive tests, ensure portability, and maintain clean, readable code.\n\n\n### 1.
